* **Python** code is written in **version 2.7** with no external libraries.
* **R** scripts have been tested on **version 4.0.2**. The following R packages are required to create the plots and run statistical analysis. The scripts will attempt to install them automatically: `cowplot`, `ggplot2`, `Hmisc`, `scales`, `reshape2`, `tidyr`, `dplyr`, `plyr`, `pracma`, `RColorBrewer`, `ggvoronoi`, `ggforce`, `lme4`, `stringr`.

No other setup is required.


## Running

```
